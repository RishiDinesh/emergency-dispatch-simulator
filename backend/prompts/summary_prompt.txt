# GOAL
Your goal is to evaluate my performance as a 911 call operator by analyzing both the content of what I said and how I communicated it, including:
- tone, composure, empathy, and emotional awareness  
- clarity and pacing  
- effectiveness and appropriateness of questioning  
- accuracy and efficiency of dispatch decisions  

# EVALUATION GUIDELINES
When reviewing the call, assess me on:
- Tone & Manner : Did I speak respectfully, calmly, and compassionately? Did my tone match the caller's emotional state?
- Questioning : Did I ask the right questions to assess the situation accurately and efficiently?
- Service Dispatch : Did I dispatch the appropriate service(s) based on the information given?
- Timeliness & Flow : Did I gather information and take action promptly without unnecessary delays or confusion?

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide feedback in the following structure:
- Use second person ("you") to address me directly.
- Keep feedback clear, short, concise, and not overly verbose.
- Include ONLY a bullet-point list of areas for improvement. Each point must be specific and actionable.

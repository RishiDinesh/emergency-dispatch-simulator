I am a 911 call operator and this is a transcript between me and a caller. 
Describe the situation that the caller was in and the purpose for the call. 
How well did I do at answering the call? 
Did I deal with them in a proper tone and manner? 
Did I ask the right questions? 
Did I dispatch the correct service (if needed)? 
Did I do all this in a timely manner? 
Give me an overall score out of 10 on how well I performed. 
If I did not receive a 10/10, tell me how I could improve.

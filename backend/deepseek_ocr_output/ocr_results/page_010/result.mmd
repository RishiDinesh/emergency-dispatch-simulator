A local or regional policy MAY exist between primary and secondary PSAPs, or agencies that participate in a regional system, that addresses unattended call transfers; however NENA recommends against unattended transfers.  


#### 2.2.7 Special Call Handling  


Regardless of the type or source, all hang- up, abandoned, or disconnected 9- 1- 1 calls for service SHOULD be 1) documented; and 2) attempt made to contact the caller based upon available technology and local policy.  


Wireless calls provide a specific challenge to the telecommunicator. Agencies are encouraged to build cooperative working relationships with cellular carriers to identify 24/7/365 contact points within cellular carrier organizations for customer information (e.g., security), and work with cellular carriers to address their concerns regarding confidentiality and liability. A sample contact list is available in Exhibit B.  


The telecommunicator may need to contact a wireless carrier to obtain a valid callback number for calls that present to the PSAP with a 911- XXX- XXXX number, for calls in which some indicator has been given that assistance may be needed, (e.g. background noise, repetitive calls). A sample exigent circumstances form is available in Exhibit C.  


#### 2.2.7.1 Abandoned Calls  


An abandoned call, sometimes referred to as a hang- up call or a short duration call, occurs:  


- When the caller disconnects before the call has been received at the PSAP or can be answered by the telecommunicator, and,- When the telecommunicator does not have enough information to determine if the call is an emergency.  


If a valid callback number is available, the telecommunicator SHOULD attempt to reestablish contact once, at a minimum, based on local policy. A PSAP may have a local policy that distinguishes different procedures dependent on the source of the call.  


#### 2.2.7.2 Disconnected Calls  


A disconnected call occurs:  


- When the caller disconnects after the call has been received at the PSAP or answered by the telecommunicator, or- When the telecommunicator does not have enough information to determine if the call is an emergency.

Event Type: Silent  


Description: A caller has dialed 9- 1- 1. The incoming call is answered by the telecommunicator. No voice is heard on the other end of the line. The presence of ambient background "clutter" (e.g., music, crying, yelling) may or may not be detectable.  


Event Type: Abandoned  


Description: A caller has dialed 9- 1- 1. Prior to the telecommunicator answering the line, the caller disconnects.1  


Lacking call types that properly discriminate one data element from another makes analysis of calls for service data, such as silent or abandoned/hang up, difficult.  


### 2.2 Call taking standards  


#### 2.2.1 Standard for answering 9-1-1 Calls  


Ninety percent (90%) of all 9- 1- 1 calls arriving at the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) SHALL be answered within \((\leq)\) fifteen (15) seconds. Ninety- five (95%) of all 9- 1- 1 calls SHOULD be answered within \((\leq)\) twenty (20) seconds. A call flow diagram is available in Exhibit A.  


The application of the standard SHALL begin at the time of Call Arrival and extend to the time of Call Answer at the point when two- way communication can begin.  


The interval between Call Arrival and Call Answer should be evaluated, at a minimum, for each preceding month using a full month of data. Determining if a PSAP has successfully met the call interval metric of 90% in 15 seconds (and 95% in 20 seconds), should be based upon the one- month evaluation. An authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) may measure this metric on a weekly or daily basis for a more detailed analysis.  


#### 2.2.2 Order of Answering Priority  


It is the responsibility of on- duty telecommunications to answer all incoming calls. All calls will be answered in order of priority:  


1. Calls received on 9-1-1 or alternate emergency access numbers (AEAN)  
2. Calls received on non-emergency lines  
3. Calls received on administrative and/or internal phone lines  


#### 2.2.3 Standard Answering Protocol - 9-1-1 Lines  


All 9- 1- 1 lines at a primary Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) SHALL be answered with the phrase "9- 1- 1" ("Nine One One").

A non- responsive call is an open voice line call or a non- voice communication where the caller is not responding to the telecommunicator. All non- responsive calls MUST be interrogated with a TTY/TDD to determine if the caller is attempting to report an emergency using a special communications device for deaf, hard of hearing, or speech impaired individuals.  


On a non- responsive call, if the telecommunicator hears background noises that indicate an emergency is occurring, such as domestic violence or difficulty breathing, the telecommunicator SHALL initiate the appropriate response. The telecommunicator SHOULD continue to monitor the open line until contact is established or the call is disconnected. If the call is disconnected, the telecommunicator SHOULD attempt to re- establish contact once, at a minimum, to determine if assistance is needed. If no direct contact (line busy, no answer, voice mail) is made after the initial attempt, any additional attempts to contact the caller SHOULD be made in accordance with local policy.  


Note: There may be wireless devices that have a data subscription plan only. The telecommunicator will not be able to complete voice contact, but may receive a network recording that the device is unable to receive a voice call.  


A non- responsive call in which there are no background noises SHALL be treated as a silent call.  


If service is not needed, the telecommunicator SHOULD note with whom they spoke, the reason 9- 1- 1 was dialed (e.g., accidental, misdial), and any other explanatory or "intuitive" observations discerned from the telecommunicator's exchange with the caller. A service disposition code SHOULD be added to the call record for statistical analysis and documentation.  


If in doubt as to the veracity of the caller's claim that 9- 1- 1 was inadvertently dialed, or that emergency services are not needed, a public safety response SHOULD be initiated, in accordance with local policy, to verify the caller is not in a threatening situation (e.g., welfare check).  


#### 2.2.8 Indicated Emergency  


Any evidence of an emergency situation (e.g., background noises) requires that the telecommunicator initiate efforts to re- contact the caller to determine the nature of the incident and an accurate location for appropriate public safety response, according to SOPs established by the local agency. If attempts to contact the caller are unsuccessful, a public safety response SHALL be initiated based on the best location available and subject to local response policy. Extraordinary attempts to locate a Phase I or Phase II wireless 9- 1- 1 disconnect caller SHALL be made in the event that an emergency is clearly indicated.

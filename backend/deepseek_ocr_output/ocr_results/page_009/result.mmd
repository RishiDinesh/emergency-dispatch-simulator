Local options depending upon preference MAY include:  


- Agencies may elect to precede "9-1-1" with their agency name.- Additional information or questions may be added, as in: "9-1-1, what is the emergency?", or "9-1-1 what is the address of the emergency?", 9-1-1 what is the location and type of emergency?" Other information, such as the operator identification number or that the line is recorded may also be added.  


#### 2.2.4 Standard Answering Protocol - Non-Emergency Lines  


When answering non- emergency lines, the answering agency SHOULD be clearly identified to the caller. Multi- agency centers MAY elect to answer with a generic identifier instead of a specific agency name.  


- Examples include: "County dispatch, Operator Name/Number_" or "Agency name, may I help you."  


#### 2.2.5 Minimum Standard for Information Gathering  


The agency will obtain and document basic information for emergency calls. At a minimum, this information SHOULD include, when available: the location of the incident, callback number, nature of the emergency and caller identity.  


#### 2.2.5.1 Location/Address Verification  


The telecommunicator SHALL verify all location information conveyed about the emergency in order to obtain the most accurate dispatchable location for emergency services response. Verification policies and associated procedures can vary based on dispatch center coverage topography and the unique characteristics of their call handling solutions.  


A verified location means that the telecommunicator has taken active measures to confirm the call- provided location is accurate and the caller has actively acknowledged or corrected, in some fashion, the location information provided.  


#### 2.2.6 Transferring emergency calls  


When calls need to be transferred to another PSAP, the telecommunicator SHALL advise the caller which PSAP they are being transferred to, in addition to advising the caller to stay on the line while the call is being transferred, such as "Please do not hang up; I am connecting you with (name of the agency)." The telecommunicator SHALL then initiate the transfer without delay. The telecommunicator SHALL stay on the line to announce the call to the transfer PSAP call taker/telecommunicator (a.k.a., "warm transfer" or "attended transfer"), and SHOULD relay the pertinent information, including, but not limited to:  


- Location- Callback number- Nature of the call- Known safety information

#### 2.2.8.7Foreign Language 9-1-1 calls  


Foreign language translation capabilities SHOULD be available to the telecommunicator to assist in processing foreign language calls received over voice, text, or video.  


#### 2.2.8.8 Redundant Calls  


Redundant calls occur when several calls have been received on the same incident. Each call SHALL be evaluated as a unique call to ensure that all pertinent and relevant information is obtained.  


#### 2.2.8.9 Repetitive Harassing 9-1-1 Callers.  


Repetitive 9- 1- 1 callers create a type of denial of service (DoS) where their calls intentionally tie up a Telecommunicator as well as potentially block out legitimate 9- 1- 1 calls. In legacy 9- 1- 1 networks, E9- 1- 1 call locations have been used by PSAPs to assist law enforcement in investigating 9- 1- 1 abuse calls. In NG9- 1- 1 Core Services, new call blocking techniques can be utilized in accordance with local policy<sup>2</sup>.  


#### 2.2.9 Incomplete or no data  


#### 2.2.9.1 Location Information Failure  


In the event of a failure to provide a caller location, an attempt to determine the location (ALI or PIDF- LO) from which the call originated SHOULD be made through reverse look- up, where permitted, or by contacting the telecommunications service provider.  


#### 2.2.9.1.1 Local Number Portability  


PSAPs might have difficulty determining the provider for a caller. The FCC's "local number portability" system allows consumers and businesses to keep their phone number when switching providers, which supports consumer choice and competition in the communications market. The transfer or "porting" of numbers between carriers is done by a neutral third party called the Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA).  


#### 2.2.9.2 Caller Contact Information Failure  


In the event a 9- 1- 1 call is received without valid caller contact information (e.g., ANI, SIP URI, Caller Line ID) displayed, the telecommunicator SHALL attempt to obtain the basic information from the caller.  


At a minimum, this information SHOULD include, when available: the location of the incident, caller identity, and call back number and nature of the emergency.

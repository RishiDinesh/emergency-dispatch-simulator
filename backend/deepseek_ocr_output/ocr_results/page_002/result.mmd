## 1 Executive Overview  


This standard has been developed to facilitate the processing of 9- 1- 1 calls by Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) and to serve as a basis for the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Use of this document standardizes the method of call handling across jurisdictional boundaries. This will provide consistency in the processing of emergency and non- emergency calls and improve service to the public.  


Over the course of the past decade, NENA published a number of Operational Standards and Information Documents that discuss the handling and processing of 9- 1- 1 calls. These documents include:  


NENA 56- 501, Silent or Hang- up Calls for Service Operational Information Document NENA 56- 001, Guidelines for Minimum Response to Wireless 9- 1- 1 Calls NENA 56- 005, 9- 1- 1 Call Answering Standard/Model Recommendation NENA 56- 006, Emergency Call Processing Protocol Standard  


These documents were developed to serve as model standard operating procedures for those Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) that receive 9- 1- 1 calls, and to provide operational guidance in handling and processing these calls.  


The present document combines and updates the current NENA standards in these areas. In undertaking this effort, NENA engaged both NFPA and APCO to ensure the harmonization of our standards. Most notable of the changes to the prior documents is the update to the standard for answering 9- 1- 1 calls, providing that \(90\%\) of all 9- 1- 1 calls be answered within 15 seconds and \(95\%\) answered within 20 seconds. The remaining call taking standards (e.g., order of answering priority, answering statement protocols, information gathering, transfer, etc.) have been updated to reflect PSAP best practices.  


Emergency Call Processing Protocols, adopted from the prior specification, have been modified to distinguish those that are required from those that are recommended.  


Normative requirements (e.g., SHALL, MUST) and recommendations (e.g., SHOULD, MAY) in this standard are indicated by the appearance of the applicable term in uppercase letters. Identical terms in lowercase letters have no special significance beyond normal usage.  


The standards defined within this document are intended as a minimum operational SOP. PSAPs SHOULD develop local policies as appropriate.

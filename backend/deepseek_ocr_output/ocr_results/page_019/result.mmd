<table><tr><td>AEAN (Alternate Emergency Access Number)</td><td>A 10-digit unlisted number, answered on a 24/7 basis, used to receive VoIP calls until these calls can be delivered to the selective router serving the PSAP. After E9-1-1-implementation, these lines should only be used for specific routing circumstances. It can also be utilized to receive misrouted calls from other PSAPs not within the selective routing service area, operator-assisted emergency calls, default-routed wireless calls, calls routed to the PSAP via private call centers, and calls relayed from telecommunications relay services. Caller identification should be included as an option.</td></tr><tr><td>ALI (Automatic Location Identification)</td><td>The automatic display at the PSAP of the caller's telephone number, the address/location of the telephone, and supplementary emergency services information of the location from which a call originates.</td></tr><tr><td>Auto Attendant Greeting</td><td>Pre-recorded global message played upon initial call arrival at the PSAP, e.g., "You have reached 9-1-1, please stay on the line".</td></tr><tr><td>Auto Greeting</td><td>Pre-recorded localized message played upon initial connection to the individual telecommunicator; this is a convenience feature to standardize call answering.</td></tr><tr><td>Call Answer</td><td>The condition when a call is delivered to and acknowledged by a telecommunicator (or an auto greeting) and two-way communication can begin.</td></tr><tr><td>Call Answered Delay</td><td>The elapsed time between call arrival and call answer.</td></tr><tr><td>Call Arrival</td><td>The condition when a call is presented to the PSAP CPE, which may include acknowledgement by an auto attendant.</td></tr><tr><td>Disconnected Call</td><td>A call placed to 9-1-1 in which the call is prematurely terminated after the call is received at the PSAP (for example, an ACD queue) or after being answered by the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) telecommunicator. Possible reasons for these calls to disconnect include: (1) Caller establishes contact but caller's situation safety demands disconnecting (e.g., kidnapping); (2) caller encounters a signal problem (e.g., mobile network coverage is lost); (3) caller encounters problems with mobile device (e.g., low battery on phone).</td></tr><tr><td>ECRF (Emergency Call Routing Function)</td><td>A functional element in an ESInet which is a LoST protocol server in which location information (either civic address or geo-coordinates) and a Service URN serve as input to a mapping function that returns a URI used to route an emergency call toward the appropriate PSAP for the caller's location or towards a responder agency.</td></tr></table>

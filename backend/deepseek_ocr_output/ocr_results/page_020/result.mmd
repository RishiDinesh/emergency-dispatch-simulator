<table><tr><td>ESRP (Emergency Service Routing Proxy)</td><td>An i3 functional element which is a SIP proxy server that selects the next hop routing within the ESInet based on location and policy. There is an ESRP on the edge of the ESInet. There is usually an ESRP at the entrance to a NG9-1-1 PSAP. There may be one or more intermediate ESRPs between them.</td></tr><tr><td>Non-responsive Call</td><td>Someone has dialed 9-1-1 and the call has been successfully answered by the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) telecommunicator, the caller did not speak, there is audio on the line such as music, yelling and/or ambient background noises can be heard (on a voice call); however, a caller is not responding to the PSAP telecommunicator. On non-voice communications, the caller does not respond to prompting by the PSAP telecommunicator.</td></tr><tr><td>PIDF-LO (Presence Information Data Format - Location Object)</td><td>Provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information in a SIP header using an XML schema.</td></tr><tr><td>Silent Call</td><td>A call placed to 9-1-1 that has successfully passed through the 9-1-1 network and has been answered by a 9-1-1 telecommunicator. Aside from the 9-1-1 telecommunicator, no voice communication is heard from the caller's end of the emergency call. The presence of ambient (background) clutter, (e.g., music, crying, yelling) is not detectable. The telecommunicator is unable to discern that there is someone at the other end of the call.</td></tr></table>

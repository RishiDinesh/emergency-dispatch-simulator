### 6.1 Operations Impacts Summary  


The Operations Impacts of using a standardized, structured approach to call processing in 9- 1- 1 and emergency communication centers includes an evaluation of existing job position descriptions, training requirements and performance evaluation instruments. In addition, it provides the ability for existing systems and processes to capture individual operator- level compliance with established call taking and response protocols, and resolves other equally important operational issues.  


Agencies must develop and employ a pre- determined plan for assigning specific responder types, resources, and response modes (hot or cold), based on the prioritization levels determined by the PSAP's call taking protocols. Development of such a plan will involve input, oversight, and approval from all department heads of affected public safety agencies. Agencies will need to evaluate the impact of any change in plans on costs, response times, status of available resources, and service- levels provided.  


### 6.2 Technical Impacts Summary  


The Technical Impacts of using a standardized, structured approach to call taking in 9- 1- 1 and emergency communication centers may vary. For example, if an emergency communication center chooses to utilize a hard copy version of a protocol system, the technical implications are minimal. If, however, an emergency communication center chooses to implement software versions of a protocol system, then pre- existing computer and network systems may be affected.  


Agencies choosing to implement software versions of a protocol system must ensure that existing systems are assessed for compatibility, so that any additional interfaces or network modifications are considered prior to software integration.  


Management Information Systems (MIS) vary in how statistics are defined, captured, and reported. Agencies should review existing MIS systems and applications to determine the impact of implementing this call answering standard and the call processing events

Calls of this type are those routed to another PSAP based upon the Policy Routing Rules of the original receiving PSAP, the existing alternate routes established by legacy PSAPs, or those which are default routed. These calls SHOULD be transferred to the PSAP having jurisdiction for the location of the emergency if possible and appropriate, after advising the caller of the transfer. If the PSAP having jurisdiction is unable to receive the call, local policy SHOULD dictate how to process the call.

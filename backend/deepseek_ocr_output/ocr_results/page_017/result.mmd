### 6.3 Security Impacts Summary  


The processing of 9- 1- 1 calls in a Next Generation environment introduces many new cybersecurity mechanisms that will impact network and PSAP operations. The most significant changes to current practice are:  


- All transactions must be protected with authentication, authorization, integrity protection, and privacy mechanisms specified in NENA STA-010 and NENA STA-75-001;- Common authentication (single sign-on) and common rights management/authorization functions are used for ALL elements in the network;  


Of necessity, PSAPs will be connected, indirectly through the ESInet, to the global Internet in order to accept calls. This means that PSAPs may experience deliberate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on their systems. NG9- 1- 1 systems must manage and protect against a multitude of vulnerabilities. This will require constant vigilance to create a secure and reliable operating environment. NG9- 1- 1 systems must have robust detection and mitigation mechanisms to deal with such attacks.  


### 6.4 Recommendation for Additional Development Work  


The call answering and call processing metrics defined in this standard are based upon those contained in earlier NENA and NFPA documents. This working group could find no evidence that there was any scientific basis for the selection of these metrics by either NENA or NFPA. It is recommended, therefore, that the public safety community be engaged to design and implement a study of call answering and call processing metrics to support or determine values that are more appropriate.  


### 6.5 Anticipated Timeline  


Many agencies may have already implemented the provisions contained in earlier versions of this standard. In the event there are provisions that have not yet been implemented, this standard should be adopted and implemented as soon as practicable.  


### 6.6 Cost Factors  


There are costs associated with the implementation of a quality assurance (QA) protocol system. Typical costs associated with a QA protocol system implementation may include, but are not limited to, the following:  


- Purchase of a commercial protocol system;- Development of an agency-specific protocol system;- Initial Trainer and telecommunicator training on the use of the protocol system;

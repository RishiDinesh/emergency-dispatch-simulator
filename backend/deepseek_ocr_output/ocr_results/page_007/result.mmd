## 2 9-1-1 Call Processing  


### 2.1 Documentation  


All 9- 1- 1 calls for services and any attempt by an agency to provide service, regardless of the type of service, SHOULD be documented by the agency.  


With the proliferation of computer aided dispatch (CAD) systems common in public safety agencies today, documentation of calls for service is essential for three reasons:  


First, by establishing a policy of documentation on all calls for service, agency administrators will be in a better position of defending not only requests for additional funding and/or personnel with true and accurate workload measures, but will also enhance their legal position in defending themselves and their agencies against service related litigation surrounding an agency's alleged failure to respond to 9- 1- 1 dialed calls. Second, by agency administrators providing clear guidance to the communications personnel on this key service related issue, their staff will benefit from the "cover" provided by management in issuing policy statements and/or procedural guidelines. Clearly, experience has shown that it is the absence of clear policy statements and/or procedural guidelines that enhance successful litigation against government agencies. Third, by establishing a policy of documentation on all calls for service, the agency can provide critical information on the sequence of factual events using audio and electronic elements such as files, call details, recordings, voice and radio transmissions associated with the incident.  


#### 2.1.1 Source Differentiation and Incident Typology  


Agency administrators should have sufficient statistical data on hand to provide their executive level management teams with accurate constituent calls for service information, especially as it relates to 9- 1- 1 access services.  


CAD systems should be programmed to accept "notational" source data for statistical purposes, and specific event codes SHOULD be developed to address all call types; examples of event codes can be found in NENA APCO 2.103.2- 2019, Common Incident Type Codes [12].  


Telecommunicators "set the tone" in their assignment of calls for service to responding resources (e.g. officers). The event code or literal "verbalized" title given a dispatched event also plays some role in setting the tone of responding units. In that respect, a more accurate descriptor of all call types should be developed. With that in mind, the following are offered as examples and are not meant to be all- inclusive:
